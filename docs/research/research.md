# Research Resources

The following pages are a collection of research produced as part of the Fabric effort. To dive deeper into based rollup research we refer to the [awesome-based-rollups](https://github.com/eth-fabric/awesome-based-rollups) and [awesome-based-preconf](https://eth-fabric.github.io/website/education/awesome-based-preconfs) pages.
