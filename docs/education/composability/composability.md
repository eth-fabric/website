We often hear that rollups are presented as the solution to fragmentation. At the same time, various initiatives, such as the [Open Intents Framework](https://www.openintents.xyz/The-Open-Intents-Framework-Intents-As-A-Public-Good-1976d35200d680fb8215f28775e067ec), are actively addressing interoperability challenges.

The goal of this series is to clarify the concept of composability, enabling a deeper understanding of the differences, limitations, and trade-offs among these approaches. This understanding will help shape Fabricâ€™s objectives as we move forward.

Note: Much of the terminology used is influenced by the writings of [Jon Charbonneau](https://dba.xyz/were-all-building-the-same-thing/#cross-chain-unbundling) and [James Prestwich](https://prestwich.substack.com/p/the-definitive-guide-to-sequencing).
