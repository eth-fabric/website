## Tying It All Together

By now we assume you have ready Based Rollup 101 and Based Rollup 201. Below is an attempt to tie this all together. The reader should keep in mind there are still a variety of ways to implement based rollups where the details vary by team / approach. We would highly ecourage visiting awesome based rollup (NEED TO ADD LINK) and [preconfs](https://github.com/eth-fabric/awesome-based-preconfs) for an exhustive list of articles, stacks, presentations and podcasts. Further, if you are not familer with traditional rollup design we would encourage teams to learn more here (INSERT LINK TO BEST PLACE TO LEARN)
