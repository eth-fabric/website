## Based Rollup Series
The following three pages help provide overviews of based rollups. They start very simple and more towards increased detail and with that complexity. We want to note that not all the complexity of based rollups is because they are based, but because L2 stacks aren't simple either. For the 301 page, we also want to note there are currently variances in designs and not all based rollups follow these flows. We have to start somewhere on presenting a view of a based rollup, and this is just the starting point. Weâ€™ll keep working with the community to refine this and expect as we all pursue more ideas and research and see implementations, will end in a different place.
