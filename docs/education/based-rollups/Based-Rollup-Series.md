## Based Rollup Series
The following three pages provide overviews of based rollups. They start with a simple introduction and gradually increase in detail and complexity. Itâ€™s important to note that not all of the complexity of based rollups comes from them being "based"; rather, L2 stacks themselves are inherently complex.

For the Threading the Needle section, we also want to highlight that there are currently variations in design, and not all based rollups follow these exact flows. This is just a starting point for presenting a view of a based rollup. We will continue working with the community to refine this, and as we explore new ideas, conduct further research, and observe implementations, the final understanding will likely evolve.
