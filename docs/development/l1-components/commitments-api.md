# Commitments API
This is currently a WIP, but the idea behind the Commitments API is to standardize how "users" request a commitments from a proposer. We'll keep updating this as we progress.

### Nice to haves
- Support both L1 and L2 commitments
- Support generic proposer commitments rather than just preconfs
- Simple wallet integration
- A way for users to get fee information
- A way for users to query gateway capabilities
